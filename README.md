#Large-eddy simulation of the ice shelf-ocean boundary layer: model output

Each folder contains output from a single simulation in a netcdf file "ISOBL_model_output.nc".

Naming convention refers to the free stream velocity (U) and the thermal driving (T) for eaach case, e.g. U07_N005 --> U=0.7 cm/s, T\*=0.005 deg

Dataset consists of profiles in the wall[ice]-normal direction (y) over time. Profiles are all averages over the horizontal (x-z) plane.

Note that in the manuscript "Regimes and transitions in the basal melting of Antarctic ice shelves" I rave renamed the co-ordinate "y" as "z" and vice-versa, as "z" is typically used/easily recognised as the vertical co-ordinate.
